## Example 2: Pattern Research

### Query
> Best practices for mobile tab vs hamburger navigation in 2025 for consumer finance apps. Include pitfalls and cite sources.

**Classification**: Pattern  
**Execution Time**: ~52 seconds  
**Sources**: Exa + Brave  
**LLM Provider**: GPT-5

### Summary

In 2025, consumer finance apps have largely standardized on a bottom tab bar with 4â€“5 items for primary navigation, leaving secondary/rarely used features to an overflow (e.g., "More") or a drawerâ€”96% of banks analyzed use bottom navigation, typically kept persistent across screens. Tab bars maximize discoverability and oneâ€‘handed, thumbâ€‘reachable access to core tasks, while hamburger drawers save space but hide options and depress exploration and engagement; topâ€‘left placement also hurts reachability on larger phones. For finance, prioritize highâ€‘frequency money tasks (e.g., transfers, bill pay, check deposit) in the tab bar, then organize the long tail in a wellâ€‘structured overflow placed as the last tab or as a static top control per platform convention.

### Best Practices

1. Adopt a persistent bottom tab bar with 4â€“5 items; prioritize money movement, mobile check deposit, accounts, and insights. Keep the bar available across most screens to preserve orientation; avoid overusing red callouts in nav or badges (reserve red for critical events).

2. Do not hide critical tasks behind a hamburger. On frequently navigated views (home, accounts), surface top actions (e.g., Transfer, Pay) visibly; use progressive disclosure to reveal additional items without burying essentials.

3. Use a hybrid model for scale: tab bar for primary, overflow ("More") or labeled 'Menu' for secondary features. Place overflow as the final bottom tab and/or a static top icon to match user expectations and improve findability.

4. Design for thumb reach and clarity: avoid topâ€‘left hamburger as the sole entry; ensure touch targets â‰¥44Ã—44 px (Material: 48 dp) and pair icons with short text labels to reduce ambiguity and improve accessibility.

5. Structure overflow menus intentionally: group related items (e.g., Profile/Settings/Statements), order by frequency, and use descriptive, conventional labels (e.g., 'Settings', 'Notifications'). Avoid deep hierarchies; keep most tasks â‰¤2 taps from entry.

6. Meet WCAG 2.2: Target Size (Minimum) 2.5.8, Focus Visible 2.4.7, Contrast (Minimum) 1.4.3, Nonâ€‘text Contrast 1.4.11, Consistent Navigation 3.2.3, and Nameâ€‘Roleâ€‘Value 4.1.2. Provide accessible names for icons (e.g., "Accounts, tab 1 of 5"), predictable focus order, and visible focus states.

7. Keep navigation performant and stable: preload nav icons, cache menu data, and use transform/opacity for animations. Aim for <100 ms first input delay and prevent layout shifts from nav appearing/disappearing (CLSâ€‘safe).

8. Validate with users: run taskâ€‘based usability tests (find Transfer, deposit a check), analyze click/flow analytics to confirm tab usage vs. overflow discovery, and A/B test labels/iconography and item ordering before broad release.

- **Never hide critical navigation on mobile** â€” Guidance to expose critical nav on navigational pages and use progressive disclosure (smart-interface-design-patterns.com)
- **Pattern tradeoffs: tab bars vs. hamburger** â€” UXPin details pros/cons: tab bars boost discoverability/ergonomics (uxpin.com)

### Considerations

**Tradeoffs**:
- Discoverability vs. content space: persistent tabs consume vertical pixels but make core tasks oneâ€‘tap visible
- Scalability vs. simplicity: tabs work best at 3â€“5 items; beyond that, rely on overflow/secondary nav
- Reachability vs. convention: topâ€‘left controls follow desktop conventions but are harder to reach on phones

**Accessibility**:
- Meet WCAG 2.2 Target Size (Minimum) 2.5.8: ensure primary tab/drawer targets â‰¥44Ã—44 px
- Provide Focus Visible 2.4.7 and logical Focus Order 2.4.3 across tabs and overflow items
- Support Keyboard/AT operation (Keyboard 2.1.1) and define Name, Role, Value 4.1.2 for tab items

**Performance**:
- Preload and cache navigation icons and labels to minimize first input delay
- Avoid layout shifts from showing/hiding nav; reserve space or use transform/opacity
- Use lightweight vector icons and shared component libraries to reduce bundle size

## Example 4: Feasibility Assessment

### Query
> Are CSS container queries production-ready in 2025? Provide browser support percentages (iOS Safari, Android Chrome, Edge), performance notes, and migration guidance.

**Classification**: Feasibility  
**Execution Time**: ~48 seconds  
**Sources**: Exa + Brave  
**LLM Provider**: GPT-5

### Summary

Yes â€” CSS container queries (size queries / @container) are production-ready for layout work in 2025; size-based container queries are widely shipped across modern Chrome, Edge and Safari releases and are safe to use for new components. Container style queries (style()) are less broadly available: support is partial (Chrome/Edge have broader support; Safari and Firefox lag), so use style queries cautiously and feature-detect or provide fallbacks. Adopt container queries progressively: prefer size queries for component layout, use container-name/container-type and containment to keep performance predictable, and keep media-query fallbacks or small JS polyfills for older browsers or for style-query gaps.

### Best Practices

1. Start with size-based container queries (@container (inline-size < Npx) / container-type: inline-size) for component layout; they are broadly supported and don't require style-query support.

2. Declare containment explicitly on containers (container-type: inline-size or container: name / inline-size) to avoid global reflow and to keep the browser from measuring every element â€” this is a performance necessity for scale.

3. Progressively enhance: ship CSS that works without container queries (using media queries or flexible layout defaults) and then layer @container rules; this ensures older browsers get reasonable layouts.

4. Feature-detect before using style() queries or use runtime detection + graceful fallback. Because style queries have partial support, gate style() rules so missing support doesn't break layout.

5. Use named containers (container-name) to avoid ambiguous matches and make rules explicit for nested components; this reduces accidental scope leakage when components are reused in different contexts.

6. Limit the number of containers you mark as size containers â€” only mark elements where descendant layout depends on the container's size â€” to reduce measurement overhead.

7. Test visually across realistic device/version matrix for: iOS Safari versions, Android Chrome versions, and Edge (Chromium) versions that your audience uses.

### Examples

- **MDN @container reference** â€” Authoritative reference and runnable examples for @container, named containers, size & scroll-state descriptors (developer.mozilla.org)
- **LambdaTest: CSS Container Queries compatibility** â€” Cross-browser support breakdown (versions) for container size queries (lambdatest.com)
- **Can I use â€” CSS Container Style Queries** â€” Compatibility table and usage-share context for style() queries (caniuse.com)
- **MDN Blog: Getting started with CSS container queries** â€” Tutorial-style walkthrough showing component-first design (developer.mozilla.org)

### Considerations

**Tradeoffs**:
- Developer ergonomics vs browser coverage â€” container size queries simplify component CSS but style() queries require handling partial support
- Performance vs feature completeness â€” enabling many size containers increases measured elements; use containment only where necessary
- CSS-only solution vs JS fallback â€” pure CSS is simpler, but older browsers may need JS-driven fallbacks

**Accessibility**:
- Reflow & content visibility: container-driven layout changes can cause reflow. Follow WCAG 2.2 / 2.1: 1.4.10 Reflow (Level AA)
- Text resizing: ensure text remains readable when users increase text size; container queries should not prevent scaling
- Focus order & keyboard: dynamic layout changes must preserve logical DOM order and keyboard focus flows (WCAG 2.1 2.4.3)
- Contrast & visibility: container-driven style switches should maintain color contrast requirements (WCAG 2.1 1.4.3, 1.4.11)

**Performance**:
- Containment is the primary performance control: mark only necessary elements with container-type
- Style queries depending on computed styles can be more expensive; prefer size queries for mass layout changes
- Measure on low-end devices: container measurement + large component counts can amplify layout costs

**Browser Support**:
- Container size queries are widely supported in modern browsers (Chromium, Safari 16.2+, Firefox) since 2023
- Container style queries are partially supported: Chrome & Edge have broader support; Safari and Firefox lag
- Use Can I Use and LambdaTest compatibility data to build test matrices

## Performance Summary

- **Average Execution Time**: 45-55 seconds
- **All queries complete**: < 120 seconds (requirement met)
- **Parallel extraction**: Reduces fetch time by ~40%
- **Streaming synthesis**: Provides progressive feedback during analysis

## Key Observations

### What Works Well
1. **Authority source ranking**: W3C, MDN, and design authorities consistently rank high
2. **WCAG coverage**: Accessibility queries get comprehensive, accurate criterion references
3. **Synthesis quality**: Agent produces original insights rather than copy-paste summaries
4. **Structured output**: Consistent format makes responses immediately usable

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Image extraction**: Some inspiration queries lack verified product screenshots
2. **Citation depth**: Some examples rely on blog aggregators vs. primary sources
3. **Quantitative claims**: Statistics like "96% of banks" need verification or removal
4. **Real product examples**: Need more canonical product documentation vs. third-party articles
